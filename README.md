# Sales-Analysis

The aim of this analysis was to to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not to spot potential bestsellers and plan advertising campaigns.

Throughout our analysis, we found out that:

1. The usual sales of a platform would last around 10 years before it reaches 0 and reach its peak around half-way;

2. The number of games released has drastically dropped in 2012 and remains stable from then;

3. The most selling and profitable platforms in the recent years are PS4, PS3, XOne;

Interestingly, the two top selling platforms did not have the highest average sales. Furthermore,the average sales of the leading platforms were the same as the average sales of the 8th top-selling platform (PS4);

4. The best selling genres are Action, Shooters, Sports;

5. Both critic and user scores influence sales, however, the critic reviews have greater impact on the sales than user reviews;

6. The users from NA and EU regions have the same preferences to platform, genre and rating of games, whereas sales in JP reflect unique preferences.

7. It cannot be rejected that the average users rating for different XOne and PC are the same, therefore, there it is highly probable that they are the same;

8. It cannot be denied that average user score for Action games and Sports games are the same, therefore most probably they are not different.

To get a clearer idea of the patterns which will help determine which game is likely to succeed, we should:

test whether critic scores differ for different platforms and genres,
create a user profile for "other_sales",
create more detailed analysis of the life-cycle of platforms since 2012.
